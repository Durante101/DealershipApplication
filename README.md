# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

The purpose of this application is to help a car dealership manage its vehicle inventory through a simple, console-based interface. Users can search for vehicles using different filters like price, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type, and they can add or remove vehicles.

## User Stories
As a salesperson, I want to view all vehicles so that I can quickly scan our current inventory.

As a customer, I want to search for vehicles by price range so I can find options within my budget.

As a customer, I want to search by make and model so I can find a specific vehicle I want.

As a sales manager, I want to search by year range so I can help customers looking for newer or older cars.

As a customer, I want to find vehicles by color so I can choose a car that matches my style.

As a mechanic, I want to search by mileage range so I can identify vehicles likely to need service soon.

As a dealership employee, I want to add new vehicles to the system so that the inventory stays up to date.

As a salesperson, I want to remove a vehicle from the inventory when it is sold.


## Setup

Instructions on how to set up and run the project using IntelliJ IDEA.
I open IntelliJ and start a new Java project, then I name the project, right-click the src folder, and create a new Java class. I paste my code into that file. If I’m using a CSV file like transactions.csv, I make sure it’s in the project folder or fix the path in the code. After that, I just hit the green play button or right-click the file and run it—the app shows up in the terminal at the bottom.
### Prerequisites

- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.
